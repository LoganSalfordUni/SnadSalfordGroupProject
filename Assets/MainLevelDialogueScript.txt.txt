"Yaay, welcome to the Underworld stranger! Congratulations, your the 1000th person to make it here by falling through that hole in the roof"
"Ofcourse, such a prestigious number requires a prize! Free beer I say! Wait... how old are you? Do you have ID?"
"..."
"Oh no, are you mute... or do you just not understand me? Nod your head if you understand me."

"Okay, thats great!"
"Since I don't know your age, you can have some juice. It comes in a bottle though, so it'll need popping open."

"Say, you're pretty helpful so I'll give you a word of advice. Folks who arrive here always wanna know how to get out. The only way is to have favour with the GATEKEEPER"
"They say the GATEKEEPER only lets souls with pure hearts free. If you help the people in the tomb with odd jobs, I'm sure that'd go a long way in proving that you are worthy"
"Hey, before you go, lemme hit you with a quick personality test to see if you're even close to being worthy... Oh don't give me that! It's only 3 questions."
"Since you're mute, you can answer by nodding for yes and shaking left and right for no (like a normal human being)"
"Alrighty, question numero uno! Would you see yourself as a nice and caring person?"
